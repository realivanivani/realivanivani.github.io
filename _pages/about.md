ðŸ¦œ Welcome to my personal webpage! You are either lost or just interested in how I'm doing. ðŸ˜Š For those who do not know me, let me briefly introduce myself...

I am a Data Scientist and Analyst with a PhD in Bioinformatics and Computational Chemistry from the University of Barcelona.

ðŸ’¼ My career spans academic research, data management and analytics in the humanitarian sector, and innovative data science in the automotive industry, bringing a wealth of experience and expertise.

ðŸ§¬ My research has explored the fields of Structural Biology, focusing on Molecular Dynamics of DNA and proteins, Quantum Mechanics calculations, drug discovery, force-field parameterization, and experimental validation.

As I'm on a journey to become a serious Data Scientist, I am regularly sharing posts and know-hows on my [blogs and posts](https://realivanivani.github.io/year-archive/) about my projects and discoveries.

Here are some of my selected work experiences

## Data Scientist in RnD unit of Continental, Serbia

I work in Continentalâ€™s R&D UX unit, where we manufacture in-car infotainment systems. My job combines data extraction and analysis, pipeline design, and data engineering, along with machine learning modeling to improve our products. I build robust data pipelines that process petabytes of manufacturing, enabling real-time insights and data-driven decision-making across international manufacturing ecosystem. I work with Manufacturing Execution System (MES) data on AWS and Oracle, covering different R&D areas and teams like Mechanical Engineering, Optical, and Display Technologies. I manage data access and analytical workflows across multiple global locations, ensuring consistency, scalability, and security. Using Power BI, I turn complex data into clear insights for engineers, leadership, and customers. I also develop Computer Vision algorithms to improve early-stage defect detection in manufacturing, always looking for new ways to use data for better decision-making.

## Data Manager & Analyst in International Committee of the Red Cross, Geneva/Amman/Damascus/Jerusalem/Caracas

After my scientific career, my path took a different turn.  Working for the ICRC as a Data Analyst and Data Manager Lead in the Protection unit was an incredible experience.  I wasn't always crunching numbers in the office, but diving deep into data from around the world both remotely and on-site in places like Geneva, Syria, Palestine, and Venezuela. As part of the Protection Unit, I was responsible for the secure processing and management of sensitive personal data, ensuring compliance with privacy regulations and internal standards across multiple geographies. I built and maintained multi-location ETL pipelines using Python and SQL, improving data reliability and operational efficiency under challenging field conditions. My role bridged operational needs with technical executionâ€”integrating field-level insights, designing scalable data workflows, and enforcing data governance for effective humanitarian action.

## Researcher in Computational Biology in Prof. Orozco's Lab, Barcelona, Spain

My scientific career began in computational biology, where I specialized in force-field parameterization and molecular dynamics simulations of DNA, RNA, and proteins. At the Orozco Lab in Barcelona, I generated and analyzed petabytes of simulation data, applying tools to analyze and extract high-resolution metadata from complex molecular systems. This work contributed to structural biology and pharmaceutical design, culminating in publications such as one  in *Nature Methods* (see my Publications tab!). I also collaborated with Dr. Eric Koolâ€™s group at Stanford, gaining industry exposure and applying my research to real-world drug discovery pipelines.

My passion for computational science continues to inform my approach to data architecture, reproducibility, and system scalability in both industry and humanitarian sectors.
