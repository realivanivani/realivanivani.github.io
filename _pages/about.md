ðŸ¦œ Welcome to my personal webpage! You are either lost or just interested in how I'm doing. ðŸ˜Š For those who do not know me, let me briefly introduce myself...

I am a Data Scientist and Analyst with a PhD in Bioinformatics and Computational Chemistry from the University of Barcelona.

ðŸ’¼ My career spans academic research, data analytics in the humanitarian sector, and innovative data science in the automotive industry, bringing a wealth of experience and expertise.

ðŸ§¬ My research has explored the fields of Structural Biology, focusing on Molecular Dynamics of DNA and proteins, Quantum Mechanics calculations, drug discovery, force-field parameterization, and experimental validation.

As I'm on a journey to become a serious Data Scientist, I am regularly sharing posts and know-hows on my [blogs and posts](https://realivanivani.github.io/year-archive/) about my projects and discoveries. The final aim? Becoming a true full-stack Data Wizard one day :)

Here are some of my selected work experiences

## Data Scientist in RnD unit of Continental, Serbia

I work in Continentalâ€™s R&D User Experience unit, where we manufacture in-car infotainment systems. My job combines data extraction and analysis, pipeline design, and data engineering, along with machine learning modeling to improve our products. I work with Manufacturing Execution System (MES) data on AWS and Oracle, covering different R&D areas like Mechanical Engineering, Optical, and Display Technologies. Using Power BI, I turn complex data into clear insights for engineers, leadership, and customers. I also develop Computer Vision algorithms to improve early-stage defect detection in manufacturing, always looking for new ways to use data for better decision-making.

## Data Analyst in International Committee of the Red Cross, Geneva/Amman/Damascus/Jerusalem/Caracas

After my scientific career, my path took a different turn â€“ the world of humanitarian aid!  Working for the ICRC as a Data Analyst and Data Manager Lead in the Protection unit was an incredible experience.  I wasn't always crunching numbers in the office, but diving deep into data from around the world both remotely and on-site in places like Geneva, Syria, Palestine, and Venezuela.  This data came from real people in real need, and my job was to make sure it was handled securely while also being readily available.  Think building reports and dashboards that helped both aid workers on the ground and colleagues back at HQ make informed decisions, fast.  It was all about using data to help the ICRC reach those who needed it most.  In short, using my data skills to make a real difference in some of the world's toughest situations.

## Researcher in Computational Biology in Prof. Orozco's Lab, Barcelona, Spain
![DNA surrounded with proteins](/images/dna_surrounded_proteins.jfif){: .align-right width="200"}
My scientific career focused on using computational biology to understand DNA, RNA, and proteins. Instead of working in a lab, I used computer simulations to study how these molecules move and interact. My main expertise was force-field parameterizationâ€”fine-tuning molecular dynamics models to create highly accurate simulations of DNA in different environments. This research plays a key role in understanding biological processes and designing new drugs. I also contributed to various projects, including a publication in *Nature Methods* (see my Publications tab!). To gain industry experience, I collaborated with Dr. Koolâ€™s lab at Stanford, working closely with the pharmaceutical sector. I'm passionate about using computational tools to explore DNA and advance medical science.
