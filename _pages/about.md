üë®‚Äçüíª  I'm a Data Scientist and Analyst, armed with a PhD in Bioinformatics and Computational Chemistry from the prestigious University of Barcelona.

üíº With a diverse background spanning academic research, data analytics in the humanitarian sector, and cutting-edge data science in the automotive industry, I bring a wealth of experience to the table.

üß¨ My research ventures delved deep into the realms of Structural Biology, encompassing Molecular Dynamics of DNA and proteins, Quantum Mechanics calculations, drug discovery, force-field parameterization, and experimental validation.

üíª I'm passionate about staying at the forefront of technology, eagerly following advancements in Machine Learning, Statistics, and Computer Vision.

üìù As a believer in knowledge transfer, I regularly contribute blogs and posts detailing my latest projects and discoveries, as I continue on my quest to ascend to the ranks of a true full-stack Data Wizard.

Selected Experiences
======

## Product Data Manager in Continental, Serbia
======
![A parrot working on a computer with robotic arm](/images/parrot_comp_robot2.jfif){: .align-right width="200"}
As a Data Manager within Continental's R&D User Experience unit, I am immersed in the dynamic world of data analytics, focusing on Manufacturing Execution System (MES) data on AWS and Oracle across the whole R&D domains, from Mechanical Engineering to Optical and Display Technologies.My mission? To wield the potent force of data, crafting actionable insights that resonate with not just leadership and clientele, but engineers as well, meticulously sculpted into captivating narratives through the lens of Power BI. But my journey doesn't stop there. Fuelled by an unyielding commitment to innovation, I lead the charge in pioneering state-of-the-art algorithms using Computer Vision, poised to revolutionize early-stage defect detection within the manufacturing arena. Guided by a relentless pursuit of excellence and an unwavering zeal for pushing the boundaries of possibility in data analytics, I flourish in an ecosystem where data-driven decision-making reigns supreme.

## Researcher in Computational Biology in Prof. Orozco's Lab, Barcelona, Spain

My academic background lies in unlocking the secrets of DNA through computational biology. Ever wondered how drugs are designed to target DNA? That's where my journey began! As a PhD in Computational Biology, I wasn't dissecting DNA in a lab (although that's pretty cool too), but diving into the world of computer simulations. My specialty? Fine-tuning programs to understand how DNA moves and interacts with proteins. Think of it as creating super accurate movies of DNA in action!  This not only helps us grasp how DNA works in different environments, but also plays a key role in designing new drugs. On top of my PhD research, I've been involved in various projects, even scoring a publication in the famous Nature Methods journal (check out my Publications tab for more!).  To expand my horizons, I also visited Dr. Kool's lab at Stanford, where I got to collaborate with the pharmaceutical industry.  So, yeah, I'm passionate about using computers to unlock the mysteries of DNA and advance medical science ‚Äì all in a day's work!

## Data Analyst in International Committee of the Red Cross, Geneva/Amman/Damascus/Jerusalem/Caracas
======
![DNA surrounded with proteins](/images/red_parrot_on_redcross_boxes.jfif){: .align-right width="200"}
After my scientific career, my path took a different turn ‚Äì the world of humanitarian aid!  Working for the ICRC as a Data Analyst and Data Manager Lead in the Protection unit was an incredible experience.  I wasn't crunching numbers on Wall Street, but diving deep into data from around the world both remotely and on-site in places like Geneva, Syria, Palestine, and Venezuela.  This data came from real people in real need, and my job was to make sure it was handled securely while also being readily available.  Think building reports and dashboards that helped both aid workers on the ground and colleagues back at HQ make informed decisions, fast.  It was all about using data to help the ICRC reach those who needed it most.  In short, using my data skills to make a real difference in some of the world's toughest situations.



**Markdown generator**

I have also created [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual markdown files that will be properly formatted for the academicpages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository.
