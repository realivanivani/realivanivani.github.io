I am a data specialist with a decade of experience in machine learning, predictive modeling, and data pipeline optimization. Proven expertise in leading data science teams, building scalable analytical models, and developing AI-driven solutions for manufacturing, bioinformatics, and business analytics. Adept at driving innovation, automating analytical workflows, and providing actionable insights to stakeholders. Iâ€™ve led international projects that required rigorous data governance, scripting for automation, and real-time decision-making support. I bring a strong foundation in computational science, cloud data workflows, and a collaborative approach to delivering reliable data infrastructure across research and development settings.
