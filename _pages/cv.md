I was born and raised in Novi Sad, Serbia, but as soon as I got scholarships I went abroad to study.

## Education

My academic journey took me to Prague, where I studied physics at Charles University after receiving a scholarship. I earned my MSc degree in Biophysics there, working on Raman spectroscopy of biomolecules. During my time in Prague, I became fluent in Czech, adding to my native Serbian. Later, I moved to Barcelona to pursue a PhD in Structural Biology under Professor Modesto Orozco. This period was crucial for my development as a scientist, and I was fortunate to contribute to some exciting research.

My scientific career began in computational biology, where I specialized in force-field parameterization and molecular dynamics simulations of DNA, RNA, and proteins. At the Orozco Lab in Barcelona, I generated and analyzed petabytes of simulation data, applying tools to analyze and extract high-resolution metadata from complex molecular systems. This work contributed to structural biology and pharmaceutical design, culminating in publications such as one  in *Nature Methods* (see my Publications tab!). I also collaborated with Dr. Eric Kool’s group at Stanford, gaining industry exposure and applying my research to real-world drug discovery pipelines.

Work experience
======

## Data Manager & Analyst in International Committee of the Red Cross, Geneva/Amman/Damascus/Jerusalem/Caracas

After my scientific career, my path took a different turn.  Working for the ICRC as a Data Analyst and Data Manager Lead in the Protection unit was an incredible experience.  I wasn't always crunching numbers in the office, but diving deep into data from around the world both remotely and on-site in places like Geneva, Syria, Palestine, and Venezuela. As part of the Protection Unit, I was responsible for the secure processing and management of sensitive personal data, ensuring compliance with privacy regulations and internal standards across multiple geographies. I built and maintained multi-location ETL pipelines using Python and SQL, improving data reliability and operational efficiency under challenging field conditions. My role bridged operational needs with technical execution—integrating field-level insights, designing scalable data workflows, and enforcing data governance for effective humanitarian action.

## Data Scientist in RnD unit of Continental, Serbia

I work in Continental’s R&D UX unit, where we manufacture in-car infotainment systems. My job combines data extraction and analysis, pipeline design, and data engineering, along with machine learning modeling to improve our products. I build robust data pipelines that process petabytes of manufacturing, enabling real-time insights and data-driven decision-making across international manufacturing ecosystem. I work with Manufacturing Execution System (MES) data on AWS and Oracle, covering different R&D areas and teams like Mechanical Engineering, Optical, and Display Technologies. I manage data access and analytical workflows across multiple global locations, ensuring consistency, scalability, and security. Using Power BI, I turn complex data into clear insights for engineers, leadership, and customers. I also develop Computer Vision algorithms to improve early-stage defect detection in manufacturing, always looking for new ways to use data for better decision-making.

My passion for computational science continues to inform my approach to data architecture, reproducibility, and system scalability in both industry and humanitarian sectors.

Over the years, I’ve developed a robust toolbox tailored to cross-domain data challenges. My expertise includes:  
- **Data Science & Analytics**: Python (pandas, scikit-learn, NumPy, statsmodels), SQL (SSMS, Posgresql), PySpark, and advanced statistical modeling.  
- **Data Engineering**: ETL pipeline design (AWS Data Engineering certification), data warehousing (Redshift, Snowflake, Oracle), and cloud-based workflows on **AWS (S3, Lambda, EC2)**.  
- **Visualization**: Power BI, Tableau, and matplotlib/seaborn, used to deliver actionable insights across technical and non-technical audiences.  
- **Machine Learning**: Regression, clustering, time-series forecasting, and computer vision models (OpenCV, PyTorch, TensorFlow/Keras).  
- **Governance & Security**: Data access control, anonymization, GDPR-compliant workflows, and secure handling of sensitive humanitarian data.  
- **DevOps & Architecture**: Git, Docker, and scalable deployment across AWS-based stacks and hybrid infrastructure.

I pride myself on translating messy, complex datasets into clean, scalable, and insightful decision systems.

My multicultural career path has helped me build strong communication skills in several languages:  
- **English** – Full professional proficiency  
- **Spanish** – Full professional proficiency  
- **Czech** – Full professional proficiency  
- **Serbian** – Native  
- **Russian** – Working proficiency  
- **German** – B1 level

These language skills have been instrumental in navigating international teams, field operations, and cross-border collaborations—from leading data workshops in Damascus to co-designing systems in Geneva and Caracas.
