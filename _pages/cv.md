I am a Data Scientist with a strong scientific background in bioinformatics and drug discovery, and five years of experience in data analytics in an international organization. I also managed small data teams of data managers and analysts. I am looking forward to bringing my international experience, problem-solving mindset, and enthusiasm to a new environment on the edge of data science and biotech.
